• Command-Line Interface (CLI): Offers a simple interface for interaction, allowing actions such as adding, editing, deleting, importing, and exporting notes.

• Search and Filtering: Employs advanced search capabilities, enabling keyword searches within encrypted notes.

• TXT Import and Export: Facilitates the import of content from TXT files to create new notes and exports notes to TXT files.
